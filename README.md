## Cakes by Yas

This project goal's was to create a webpage where you can order your cake, see the price and see when it is going to be ready 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Text input (HTML);
- Radio input (HTML);
- Number input (HTML);
- Responsive design (CSS);
- Submit form (JavaScript);
- If/else (JavaScript).
